/* Readable URLs.
 *
 * Three kinds of tidying:
 *   - named pages     /kart-circuit  -> games/mario-kart/index.html
 *   - a game link     /snake         -> index.html, opened on Snake
 *   - a bare folder   /games         -> the hub's game shelf
 *
 * The game link is what makes a game shareable at all: the hub is a single
 * page, so all 85 games used to sit at the same URL and "come play Snake" could
 * only ever link to the front door. Serving index.html for /<id> and letting
 * js/app.js read the path on load turns that into a real link.
 *
 * Deliberately ONE path segment, not /play/<id>. A page served at a deeper path
 * than the file it came from resolves all its relative URLs against that deeper
 * path — so under /play/snake every <script src="js/..."> in index.html is
 * requested from /play/js/... and 404s. (Confirmed by loading it: the whole hub
 * came back empty.) A single segment resolves against the root, which is where
 * index.html actually lives, so nothing needs a <base> and nothing can drift
 * out of sync with it later.
 *
 * Nothing here can reach a file the plain path couldn't: the named routes are
 * an exact-match table, and the game link only ever resolves to index.html.

//    server never sees, receives, or stores anything biometric. All it ever
//    handles is a public key and a signature-verification ceremony, exactly
//    like every other WebAuthn Relying Party. See MDN's WebAuthn docs for the
//    ceremony shape if any of this looks unfamiliar.
// 2. An optional recovery email — stored for reference only. This hub has no
//    mail server configured (it's a local/LAN dev server with a self-signed
//    cert, not a real hosted service), so this can't actually send a reset
//    link; it's shown back to a dev doing manual support, nothing more. Not
//    oversold as more than that anywhere in the UI copy either.
// 3. A one-time recovery code, generated on request and shown exactly once —
//    this is what actually solves "I forgot my password and there's no email
//    server to reset it with." Single-use: using it to set a new password
//    immediately invalidates it, same as any backup-code scheme.
